# Running locally

### Instructions:
* Put the source image inside the folder
* Set the name of the source image in the `alg.py`
* Install the dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the script via `python alg.py`

The resulting image is saved on every iteration of the algorithm, so you can open it and see how it changes

**Important!** Be aware that since the program uses multiprocessing, the performance of your computer may be poor during the execution of the algorithm
